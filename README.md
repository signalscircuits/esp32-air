ESP32-S2 USB Air Quality  Monitor

 Air Quality  Monitor Based on ESP32-S2

The ESP32 S2 is a powerful microcontroller that can be used as the main controller for various applications. One of its advantages is that it has a built-in USB interface, which allows easy communication with a host computer or other devices. In this project, I will use the ESP32 S2 as the main controller for a device that can measure the CO2, VOC and NOx levels in the air. The system use the SCD40 CO2 sensor, which is a high-accuracy and low-power sensor that can measure CO2 concentration from 400 ppm to 2000 ppm. The system also  use the SGP41-VOC and NOx sensor, which is a low-power sensor that can measure volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) in the air. The sensors are connected to the ESP32 S2 via I2C interface, and the data is stored in a 16MB external storage module. The device can display the data on an 0.96" LCD IPS screen or send it to a cloud service via Wi-Fi .
